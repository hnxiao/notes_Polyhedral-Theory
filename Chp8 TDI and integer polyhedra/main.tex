Note that TDI is a property of a system of inequalities, \emph{not} a property of the corresponding polyhedron. Systems
\[
\left\{ x\in \R^2~:~
\begin{array}{l}    
    x_1\geq 0,~x_2\geq 0\\
    x_1+2x_2\leq 6\\
    2x_1+x_2\leq 6
\end{array}
\right\}
~~\mbox{and}~~
\left\{ x\in \R^2~:~

    2x_1+x_2\leq 6\\

    {\color{red} x_1\leq 3,~x_2\leq 3}
\end{array}
\right\}
\]
define the same polyhedron $P=\mbox{conv}\{(0,0),(3,0),(2,2),(0,3)\}$. But the first system, however, is not TDI. For example, if we take the cost vector $c^T$ to be $(1,1)$, then the primal maximum is achieved by $(2,2)$ with value $4$. But $(1,1)$ cannot be expressed as a linear integer combination of $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$, the normal vectors of the tight constraints at point $(2,2)$. Therefore, there is no integral dual optimum and the first system is not TDI.

Nevertheless, after extending the first system with some redundant constraints, we have an additional normal vector at $(2,2)$, namely, $(1,1)$. And now $(1,1)$ is an integer combination of the normal vectors at $(2,2)$. Moreover, the second system is in fact TDI.

And this example also shows that a TDI-system usually contains more constraints than necessary for defining the polyhedron.

A deeper look into this example actually gives necessary for a system to be TDI. We explain this in general context. Consider the problem $\max\{c^T x|Ax\leq b\}$ with $c$ integral, and assume it has finite optimum $\delta$. Then it is achieved by some vector $x^*$ in the face $F$ defined by the intersection of $x|Ax\leq b$ with the hyperplane $c^T x=\delta$. For simplicity assume that the face $F$ is an extreme point of the polyhedron and let $A'x=b'$ be the set of all inequalities in $Ax\leq b$ that are tight at $x^*$. The dual is $\min\{y^T b|y\geq 0, y^T A=c\}$. By LP duality theory, $c$ can be expressed as a non-negative combination of the row vectors of $A'$(, in other words $c$ is in the cone of the row vector of $A'$). As entries of $y$ corresponding to non-tight constraints in $A$ must be $0$. TDI of $Ax\leq b$ requires that there is an integer solution to $yA'=c,y\geq 0$ for any integral $c$. (Geometrically, any integral $c$ in the cone generated by row vectors of $A'$ can be expressed as a non-negative combination of row vectors of $A'$.) Recall that every rational cone admits a Hilbert basis, of which each integral vector in this cone can be expressed as the non-negative integer combination. This observation motivates the following theorem, which reveals the the realtion between TDI and Hilbert bases.

\section{TDI system and Hilbert bases}

\begin{theorem}
The rational system $Ax\leq b$ is TDI if and only if for each face $F$ of the polyhedron $P:=\{x|Ax\leq b\}$, the rows of $A$ which are tight in $F$ form a Hilbert basis.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\textbf{Remark:} In fact we showed in the proof that we can restrict $F$ in the theorem above to minimal face.

\emph{\textbf{minimal TDI}}

\begin{theorem}
For each rational polyhedron $P$ there exists a TDI-system $Ax\leq b$ with $A$ integral and $P=\{x|Ax\leq b\}$. And $b$ can be chosen to be integral if and only if $P$ is integral. Moreover, if $P$ is full-dimensional, there exists a unique minimal TDI-system.
\end{theorem}

The example above raises the question of whether one can take any rational system $Ax\leq b$ and make it TDI by adding sufficiently many redundant inequalities. Indeed that is possible, and this is based on the theorem that ``every rational polyhedral cone has a finite integral Hilbert basis''

We use our previous example to demonstrate this. In our previous example, a Hilbert basis for the cone (the dual cone associated with vertex $(2,2)$) defined by the vectors $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ is given by the set of vectors $H=\{(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)\}$. We can get the additional vector $(1,1)$ by adding the redundant constraint $x_1+x_2\leq 4$ in the first system.

Successively considering the dual cones corresponding to the vertices $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$ and $(0,3)$, one can show that the linear system ?????? is TDI. For example, the cone corresponding to the vertex $(3,0)$ has a Hilbert basis $\{(2,1),(1,0),(0,-1)\}$.
