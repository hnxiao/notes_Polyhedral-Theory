The reason why we put the fundamental theorem of linear inequalities, decomposition theorem of polyhedra, and Farkas' lemma in the same place is that: the following those results are the corollaries of `` The fundamental theorem of linear inequalities''. So the fundamental theorem of linear inequality is the key throughout this notes. This points can not be overemphasized.

The fundamental theorem of linear inequalities is an typical example of theorem of alternatives.

\section{The Fundamental theorem of linear inequalities}



\section{Cones, polyhedra, and polytopes}

We restrict ourselves to Euclidean space throughout our discussion of polyhedral theory?

Before we can actually start with discrete geometry we need to review some material from linear algebra and fix some terminology.

Let $x_1,\dots,x_k\in \K^n$, and $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_k\in \K$. The $\sum_{i=1}^{k}\lambda_i x_i$ is called a \emph{\textbf{linear combination}} of vectors $x_1,\dots,x_k$. It is further a (i) \emph{\textbf{conical combination}}, if $\lambda_i\geq 0$; (ii)  \emph{\textbf{affine combination}}, if $\sum_{i=1}^{k}\lambda_i =1$; and a
(iii) \emph{\textbf{convex combination}}, if it is both conical and affine.

The  \emph{\textbf{linear}}(\emph{\textbf{conical}}, \emph{\textbf{affine}},  \emph{\textbf{convex}})  \emph{\textbf{hull}} of a set $X\subseteq \K^n$ is the set of vectors that  are linear(or, conical, affine, convex, respectively) combinations of vectors in $X$. It is denoted by $\mbox{lin}(X)$(or, $\mbox{cone}(X)$, $\mbox{aff}(X)$, $\mbox{conv}(X)$, respectively). $X$ is a  \emph{\textbf{linear space}}(\emph{\textbf{cone}},  \emph{\textbf{affine space}},  \emph{\textbf{convex set}}) if $X$ equals its linear hull(or, conical hull, affine hull, convex hull, respectively).

For any non-zero vector $a\in\K^n$ and $\beta\in \K$, the set $\{x~|~a^T x\leqslant 0\}$ is a  \emph{\textbf{linear half-space}}, and $\{x|a^T x\leqslant \beta\}$ is an \emph{\textbf{affine half-space}}. Their boundaries $\{x|a^T x=0\}$ and $\{x|a^T x=\beta\}$ are a  \emph{\textbf{linear}} and  \emph{\textbf{affine hyperplane}} respectively.

We can now define the basic objects that we will study in polyhedral theory.

A  \emph{\textbf{polyhedral cone}} is a cone $C\subseteq\K^n$ of the form
\begin{equation*}
C:=\{x~|~Ax\leqslant 0\}
\end{equation*}
for some matrix $A$, i.e., $C$ is the intersection of \emph{finitely} many linear half-spaces. 

Recall that a cone $C:=\mbox{cone}(X)$ is all the conical combinations of vectors in $X$. We say vectors in $X$ \emph{\textbf{generate}} cone $C$.
Obviously, it is the smallest convex cone containing $x_1,\dots,x_m$. A cone arising in this way is called  \emph{\textbf{finitely generated}}.

It now follows from the Fundamental theorem that for cones the concepts of `polyhedral' and `finitely generated' are equivalent.

It is intuitively obviously that the concepts of polyhedron and of polytope are related. This is made more precise in the Decomposition theorem for polyhedra and in its direct corollary, the Finite basis theorem for polytopes.
\begin{definition} For two subsets $P$, $Q\subseteq \K^n$, the set 
\begin{equation*}
P+Q:=\{p+q~|~p\in P, q\in Q\}
\end{equation*}
is the \emph{\textbf{M{\scriptsize INKOWSKI}  sum}} of $P$ and $Q$.
\end{definition}

It follows form the Fundamental theorem that for cones the concepts of `polyhedral' and `finitely generated' are equivalent.

\begin{theorem}[F{\scriptsize ARKAS}-M{\scriptsize INKOWSKI}-W{\scriptsize EYL} Theorem]
A convex cone is polyhedral if and only if it is finitely generated.
\end{theorem}

\emph{\textbf{Finite basis theorem for polyhedral cones}}.

\begin{theorem}[M{\scriptsize INKOWSKI}-S{\scriptsize TEINITZ}-W{\scriptsize EYL} Theorem]
A subset $P\subseteq\K^n$ is a polytope if and only i $P$ is a bounded polyhedron.
\end{theorem}

\emph{\textbf{Finite basis theorem for polytopes}}.

\section{Homogenization}
In our notation system,  polyhedral cones are defined to be special polyhedra with right hand side $b=0$. In this section we shall show that they are in a sense as general as polyhedra. Indeed we shall construct for a given polyhedron $P\subseteq \K^n$ a polyhedral cone $C$ which still contains all information about $P$. Needless to say that polyhedral cones usually are much easier to handle than general polyhedra. Therefore this construction principle, the so called ``homogenization'', together with the corresponding inverse operation, the so called ``dehomogenization" are useful tools in polyhedral theory.

We associated a polyhedron $P\subseteq \K^n$ with a polyhedral cone $C\subseteq\K^{n+1}$ by embedding $P\subseteq\K^n$ into a hyperplane $x_{n+1}=1$ of $\K^{n+1}$ and letting $P$ be the intersection of polyhedral cone $C$ with hyperplane $x_{n+1}=1$ in $\K^{n+1}$.

Mathematically, let $P\subseteq \K^n$ be a polyhedron. Then the set
\begin{equation}
\mbox{homog}(P)=\{\lambda\begin{pmatrix}x\\1\end{pmatrix}: x\in P, \lambda\in \K_+\}+\{\begin{pmatrix}x\\0\end{pmatrix}:x\in\mbox{char.cone}(P)\}
\end{equation}
is called the \emph{\textbf{homogenization}} of $P$.

Alternatively, $\mbox{homog}(P)$ can be represented by
\begin{equation}
\mbox{homog}(P)=\{\begin{pmatrix}x\\x_{n+1}\end{pmatrix}\in\K^{n+1}:Ax\leq x_{n+1}b,x_{n+1}\geqslant 0\}
\end{equation}

The following result provides an explicit description of $\mbox{homog}(P)$ in terms of a system of linear inequalities.

\begin{proposition}
Let $P=P(A,b)$ be a polyhedron in $\K^n$. Then the homogenization of $P$ is $P(B,0)$, where
\begin{equation}
B:=\begin{pmatrix}A & -b \\ 0 & -1\end{pmatrix}\in \K^{(m+1)\times(n+1)}.
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

H-representation for homogenization

$\mbox{homog}(P)$ can be represented by
\begin{equation}
\mbox{homog}(P)=\{\begin{pmatrix}x\\x_{n+1}\end{pmatrix}\in\K^{n+1}:Ax\leq x_{n+1}b,x_{n+1}\geqslant 0\}
\end{equation}
Thus, we can see that $\mbox{homog(P)}$ is the H-cone given by the system of inequalities 
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}x\\x_{n+1}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x\\x_{n+1}\end{pmatrix}\leqslant \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
and that (do we need the following part?)
\begin{equation}
P=\mbox{homog}(P)\cap \{x\in\K^{n+1}~|~x_{n+1}=1\}
\end{equation}
Conversely, if $C$ is any H-cone in $K^{n+1}$(in fact, any H-polyhedron), it is clear that $P=C\cap\ \{x~|~x_{n+1}=1\}$ is an H-polyhedron in $K^n$.


Inner representation.

Let $P\subseteq\K^n$ is a V-polyhedron, $P=\mbox{conv}(X)+\mbox{cone}(Y$, where $X=\{x_1,\dots,x_p\}$ and $Y=\{y_1,\dots, y_q\}$.

Define $\hat{X}=\{\hat{x}_1,\dots,\hat{x}_p\}\subseteq\K^{n+1}$ and $\hat{Y}=\{\hat{y}_1,\dots,\hat{y}_p\}\subseteq\K^{n+1}$, by
$\hat{x}_i=\begin{pmatrix}x_i\\1\end{pmatrix}$, $\hat{y}_j=\begin{pmatrix}y_j\\0\end{pmatrix}$.
We check immediately that 
$\mbox{homog}(P)=\mbox{cone}(\hat{X}\cup\hat{Y})$ is a V-cone in $\K^{n+1}$ and such that 
$P=\mbox{homog}(P)\cap H_{n+1}$.

Conversely, if $C=\mbox{cone}(W)$ is a V-cone in $K^{n+1}$, with $w_{n+1}\geqslant 0$ for every $w_{n+1}\in W$($w_{i,n+1}\geqslant 0$ for every $w_{i,n+1}\in W$), then $P=C\cap H_{n+1}$ is a V-polyhedron in $\K^n$.

Homogenization and de-homogenization actually reveal the correspondence between polyhedron and cone.


\section{Decomposition theorem for polyhedra}
\begin{theorem}[Decomposition theorem for polyhedra]
A subset $P\subseteq \K^n$ is a polyhedron if and only if $P=Q+C$ for some polytope $Q$ and some polyhedral cone $C$.
\end{theorem}
